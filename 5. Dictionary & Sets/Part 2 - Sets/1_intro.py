""" A Set is an unordered collection (i.e., values are not stored in the sequence way we add them to, values are always stored in a sorted way) data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. This is based on a data structure known as a hash table. Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes like we do in lists. """

""" Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements. """
""" A set is always sorted (acc to ASCII table) """
